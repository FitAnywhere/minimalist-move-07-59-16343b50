                1. Digest less, defend more
              </h3>
              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Most people live in a constant state of digestionâ€”snacking, bloating, crashing.
                But 70% of your immune system lives in your gut. If your body's always digesting, it can't clean house.

              <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                Step outside first thing in the morning. Face the sunlight. Breathe through your nose.
                This isn't theoryâ€”it's circadian biology. Morning light tells your brain to lower melatonin and strengthen immune response.
                Nasal breathing boosts nitric oxide, widens blood vessels, and improves oxygen flow.

                A cold shower isn't punishmentâ€”it's a biological wake-up call.
                Cold exposure triggers norepinephrine (focus, energy) and boosts production of immune cells like lymphocytes and monocytes.
                It reduces inflammation, sharpens your mind, and hardens your nervous system.

                Viruses, bacteria, and even cancer love sugar.
                What they hate? Stable blood sugar and clean fuel from real food.
                Every time you skip sugar, your immune system wins.
